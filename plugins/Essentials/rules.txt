Conduct:
1. No ad hominems
2. Avoid drama;  do not escalate.
3. Only invite people you are actually friends with.  This is not to become a truly public MC server.
4. Your Discord nickname should be your Minecraft username or your SettleScape nickname.

Griefing Policy:
1. Don't grief.
2. Everyone has unlimited chest locks, so unlocked containers in public spaces are fair-game for anyone, and not considered griefing.
